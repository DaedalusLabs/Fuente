How will we register business or users? Open, whitelists, blacklists, etc.
Ask about the drivers, external, internal, do we need to split payments with them?
Ask about settlement flow, htlc can be settled at various points of flow 
Settlement is final with LN txs so we need to have a refund procedure
Data collection (by default most thing can be encrypted, but we need to know what data we are collecting)

Language support
Currency exchange rate

Ideal System

whitelisted businesses, open to users, but can be blacklisted
internal drivers get notified of order
settlement happens when driver completes delivery, because driver is trusted
payments will be registered by default on the node
server must see order to verify against menu and request invoice from business LNURL 
server will always know payment status so can keep track of CANCELED, SETTLED ratios
